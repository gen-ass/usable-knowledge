# Usable knowledge site
The purpose was to allow users to utilise resources to assist them in teaching primary school children. In order to facilitate this the site content was categorised into pre-defined categories.

Each category could be filtered and searched for ease of finding content. Information on the site was extracted from lists on the SharePoint 2013 CMS, populated with content provided by the site owner.

## What was used
Pages was developed in C# and content was then rendered using JavaScript. The existing HTML and CSS resources of the site was utilised for display purposes.

## Who was involved
I was responsible for the mock-up and workflow design and testing of the features. The development was done by another developer who oversaw developing the site. Corporate Identity design was checked by the Universityâ€™s Brand Manager.

## Continued support
After design and development was realised the site was handed over to the site owner. Training was provided by me to assist the users in updating the site.
